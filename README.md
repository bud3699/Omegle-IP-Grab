# Omegle-IP-Grab

(Educational purposes only)


## Why?

When using chrome extensions sometimes omegle has features in place to find extensions like this and ban you for it
This way it is less risky (NOT COMPLETELY FREE OF RISK) then using a extension to grab the IP

## Info

This script is console based and should be ran inside the devs console
